## Oslo Throwdown Event Visualization

In collaboration with **Oslo Throwdown**, I created a comprehensive 3D visualization and animated flythrough showcasing their event at **Unity Arena**. This project featured detailed modeling and precise layout planning, encompassing multiple distinct areas:

### Event Areas

**Eleiko Main Arena:**
The core competition area meticulously designed with athlete stations, equipment placements, and spectator seating.

**Warm-up Area:** A specialized zone equipped with training and warm-up facilities, carefully arranged for athlete preparation and seamless transitions to the main competition floor.

**Vendor Village:** An engaging commercial area strategically arranged with vendor booths, merchandise stands, and interactive spaces.

**Nocco Arena:** A versatile secondary arena designed for additional competitions and activities, significantly expanding event capabilities and versatility.

**Media and Interview Zone:** Professionally configured for media coverage, live broadcasts, and interviews, featuring optimal lighting, branding, and equipment for high-quality content creation.

### Animated Flythrough

The animated flythrough vividly communicated the event's scale, layout, and atmosphere, serving as a powerful promotional tool for sponsors, stakeholders, and attendees. It was developed using software tools like:

- **Blender** for detailed 3D modeling and animations
- **DaVinci Resolve** for color grading and final editing
