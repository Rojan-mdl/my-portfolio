Initially, I created a promotional video highlighting Unity Arena's innovative **"Black Box"** concept. This setup transforms the arena into versatile event spaces—**Bowl**, **Box**, and **Full**—using large mortar cloth partitions supported by an advanced truss system. This video became an essential marketing tool, effectively showcasing the arena's adaptability.

Following the rebranding from Telenor Arena to Unity Arena, I updated this promotional material to align with the new brand identity, significantly improving its visual quality and presentation.

The latest Black Box video featured comprehensive 3D visualizations demonstrating:

- **Bowl Configuration:** A primary stage, standing and seated areas, and a dedicated **"Fan Zone"** for food vendors and merchandise.
- **Box Configuration:** A more intimate setup ideal for medium-sized events.
- **Center Stage Configuration:** A central stage providing audience access from all sides, ideal for dynamic, high-engagement performances.

These visuals effectively communicate the arena's versatility and capacity to accommodate diverse event types.
