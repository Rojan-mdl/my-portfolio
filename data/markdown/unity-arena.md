## Unity Arena Collaboration Overview

My collaboration with Unity Arena (formerly known as Telenor Arena) includes various distinct projects aimed at enhancing visualization, promotional capabilities, and visitor experience for the arena.

### Black Box Concept Videos
Initially, I created a promotional video highlighting Unity Arena's innovative **"Black Box"** concept. This setup transforms the arena into versatile event spaces—**Bowl**, **Box**, and **Full**—using large mortar cloth partitions supported by an advanced truss system. This video became an essential marketing tool, effectively showcasing the arena’s adaptability.

Following the rebranding from Telenor Arena to Unity Arena, I updated this promotional material to align with the new brand identity, significantly improving its visual quality and presentation.

The latest Black Box video featured comprehensive 3D visualizations demonstrating:

- **Bowl Configuration:** A primary stage, standing and seated areas, and a dedicated **"Fan Zone"** for food vendors and merchandise.
- **Box Configuration:** A more intimate setup ideal for medium-sized events.
- **Center Stage Configuration:** A central stage providing audience access from all sides, ideal for dynamic, high-engagement performances.

These visuals effectively communicate the arena's versatility and capacity to accommodate diverse event types.

### Rebranding Transition
I produced the official announcement video for Unity Arena's rebranding from Telenor Arena, effectively establishing and communicating the new brand identity. Additionally, I provided Unity Arena with custom Blender files, allowing their marketing team to independently create tailored visual content internally.

### Seating Charts and Layouts
I created detailed seating charts customized for various event setups. These charts improved event organization, ticketing processes, and client interactions by clearly and accurately depicting seating arrangements.

### Visitor Experience Enhancement
Most recently, I developed a concise, engaging video that illustrates the optimal walking route from Lysaker station to Unity Arena. Utilizing Google Earth scanned data combined with animated pedestrian models, this video enhances visitor accessibility, ensuring attendees have a seamless and enjoyable experience.

Throughout these projects, I consistently employed professional software including **Blender** for 3D modeling and rendering, **Adobe After Effects** for animations and compositing, and **DaVinci Resolve** for color grading and video editing, resulting in polished and impactful visual content.
