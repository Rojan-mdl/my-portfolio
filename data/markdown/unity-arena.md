## Unity Arena Collaboration Overview

My collaboration with Unity Arena (formerly known as Telenor Arena) includes various distinct projects aimed at enhancing visualization, promotional capabilities, and visitor experience for the arena.

(Details on specific sub-projects like Black Box, Rebranding, Seating Charts, and Visitor Experience can be found within the respective sections on this page.)

Throughout these projects, I consistently employed professional software including **Blender** for 3D modeling and rendering, **Adobe After Effects** for animations and compositing, and **DaVinci Resolve** for color grading and video editing, resulting in polished and impactful visual content.
