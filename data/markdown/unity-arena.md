## Unity Arena Collaboration Overview

My collaboration with Unity Arena (formerly known as Telenor Arena) includes various distinct projects aimed at enhancing visualization, promotional capabilities, and visitor experience for the arena.

Throughout these projects, I consistently used software including **Blender** for 3D modeling and rendering, **Adobe After Effects** for VFX and compositing, and **DaVinci Resolve** for color grading and video editing, resulting in polished and impactful visual content.
